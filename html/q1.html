		<h5>About Us</h5>
		<p>As we live in a digital age where Computer Science & Engineering impacts everything, <br>from scientific research to health development, transport, banking, communications, etc.<br> 
		But this didn’t happen by magic. We arrived here because of the brilliant minds of CSE graduates,<br> who took their passion for technology and used it to create gadgets and <br>
		computer programs which help us every single day. Luise Pasteur once said,<br> “Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, <br>and is the torch which 
		illuminates the world”. So its needless to say,<br> Computer Science and Engineering is not just about science, it is about improving every aspect of life.</p>
